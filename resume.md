Profile
-------

* Mathematics and mathematics-related activities pique my
  interests. Some of my other pursuits include writing code for both
  free software projects and my own personal amusement, and practicing
  Brazilian jiu-jitsu.

Professional Interests
----------------------

* While I have a deep love and appreciation for the traditional foci
  of pure mathematics, my passions lie in mathematics that I can play
  with. For example, I hold (and have held for quite some time) a keen
  interest in cryptography and computer security. The majority of my
  open source contributions are to projects within this area. Lately I
  have become immersed with research on peer-to-peer and cloud
  technologies, and find both topics fascinating.

Education
---------

* **[University of Florida](http://ufl.edu)** 

    B.S.
     [Mathematics](https://catalog.ufl.edu/ugrad/current/liberalarts/Majors/mathematics.aspx)
     with a minor in [Computer
     Science](http://cise.ufl.edu/academics/undergrad/minor/), Spring
     2011 &mdash; Spring 2013

    - Current overall GPA is 3.91, major GPA is 4.0.

* **[Grooveshark University](http://grooveshark.com/#!/about/university)**

    Participant, Spring 2013

    - Participated in a ten week long professional training course
      (taught by [Prof. Dave Small](http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~dts/) of
      the University of Florida) on the fundamentals of mobile
      application development using the Android Jelly Bean operating
      system.

* **[Brevard Community College](http://www.brevardcc.edu)**

    A.A. General Education, Summer 2011 &mdash; Fall 2010

    - Final overall GPA of 3.93.

Industry &amp; Research Experience
----------------------------------

* **[Advanced Computing and Information Systems Laboratory](http://acis.ufl.edu/)**

    Undergraduate Research Assistant, Fall 2012 &mdash; Spring 2013

    - Accepted a Research Experience for Undergraduates position under
      [Prof. Renato Figueiredo](http://byron.acis.ufl.edu/) and
      Ph. D. candidate [Pierre
      St. Juste](http://pstjuste.blogspot.com/) working on distributed
      virtual private networks (i.e., IPOP [IP Over P2P], GroupVPN and
      SocialVPN). In particular, I assisted in the implementation of
      simple inter-cloud communication for the Contrail cloud platform
      via the utilization of a P2P overlay in the form of IPOP, and
      worked to secure the communication between nodes through the use
      of IPsec.  

    - The culmination of our efforts was
      [Acheron](https://github.com/acis-acheron/acheron).

* **[Ultimate Software](http://ultimatesoftware.com)**

    Software Engineer Intern (TechSTAR), Summer 2012

    - Worked on a myriad of projects as a member of the Architecture
      Refactoring Team, who are tasked with maintaining and improving
      both the underlying architecture and various other components of
      UltiPro, Ultimate Software's flagship enterprise Human Capital
      Management solution. 

    - Utilized various languages and tools, including C#, ASP.NET,
      JavaScript, jQuery, Knockout, HTML 5 and CSS 3.

Open Source Experience
----------------------

Please see my [GitHub](https://githun.com/thomdixon) for a more
complete listing of open source projects and contributions. I have
provided a list of selected projects below.

* **[SymPy Symbolic Computation Library](http://sympy.org)**

    Open Source Contributor, November 2010

    - Contributed a pull request to fix a number of the problems in
      Issue 2085, where several limits (particularly left- and
      right-sided limits) were not being calculated correctly. Also
      fixed a `ZeroDivisionError` when `cos(x)` was called with an
      infinite argument.

* **[dcrypt Cryptography Library](http://www.dsource.org/projects/dcrypt)**

    Project Founder, August 2008 &mdash; March 2010

    - Founded and maintained an open source initiative to provide a
      standard cryptographic toolkit (focusing on symmetric
      primitives) written entirely in the D programming language. As
      of March 2010, a majority of dcrypt was merged into the [Tango
      standard library](http://www.dsource.org/projects/tango).

* **[Bouncy Castle Java Cryptography Extension](http://www.bouncycastle.org)**

    Open Source Contributor, 2006 &mdash; 2008

    - Provided the initial implementations of the TEA, XTEA, Salsa20,
      ISSAC and direct-key NOEKEON ciphers, as well as further
      enhancements to XTEA (the memoization of round keys to speed up
      encryption and decryption).

* **[SuperSFV](http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/23168/supersfv)**

    Project Founder, 2007

    - SuperSFV is a simple file verification program designed for Mac
      OS Tiger and released under the GNU GPLv2. Development for this
      application ceased when I switched to Linux, however, the source
      remains available and has inspired some
      [forks](https://github.com/search?q=supersfv).

Seminars &amp; Talks
--------------------

* **Programming for Aspiring Mathematicians**, Fall 2011 &mdash; Spring 2012

    - Gave a two-semester seminar on the fundamentals of computer
      programming to Pi Mu Epsilon, the University of Florida’s
      official mathematics club. Utilizing the Python programming
      language, my goal was to provide a glimpse into the world of
      general purpose programming, leading up to the piéce de
      résistance of introducing the elements of the [Sage mathematical
      system](http://sagemath.org).

Technical Skills
----------------

* **Programming**

    - Familiar with C, Python, TeX, LaTeX; somewhat familiar with PHP,
      C#, Ruby, Java, Objective-C, C++, Perl, (Common) Lisp,
      Scheme. Understanding of a wide range of paradigms, such as
      imperative, object-oriented, functional, and algebraic, at
      various levels of abstraction.

* **SCM &amp; Libraries**

    - Experience with source-control systems such as Subversion (svn),
      Mercurial (hg), and Git. Some experience with development
      libraries such as GTK and Qt.

* **Applications**

    - GNU Compiler Collection, Intel's Development Suite, Emacs,
      Microsoft Office&reg;, and other common productivity packages
      for Windows&reg;, Apple Mac OS X, and Linux platforms.

* **Operating Systems**

    - Microsoft Windows&reg; XP, Vista, &amp; 7, Apple Mac OS X
      (Cheetah to Leopard), Linux (e.g., Gentoo, Debian,
      Fedora). Personally, I use Debian Wheezy with Gnome 3.
