Profile
-------

* I am a software developer with a passion for free and open source
  software, and a deep interest in computer security and cryptography
  (the majority of my open source contributions are to projects within
  this area). Some of my other pursuits outside of coding include
  playing electric guitar and practicing Brazilian jiu-jitsu.

Education
---------

* **[University of Florida](http://ufl.edu)**

    B.S.
     [Mathematics](https://catalog.ufl.edu/ugrad/current/liberalarts/Majors/mathematics.aspx)
     with a minor in [Computer
     Science](http://cise.ufl.edu/academics/undergrad/minor/), Spring
     2011 &mdash; Spring 2013

    - Graduated with a final overall GPA of 3.91.

Industry &amp; Research Experience
----------------------------------

* **[Ultimate Software](http://ultimatesoftware.com)**

    Security Engineer, June 2014 &mdash; Present

    - I'm currently a developer on the team responsible for creating Ultimate's
      Security Operations Center (SOC). I write and manage software that assists
      in the detection and resolution of infiltration attempts.

    - Developed a plugin-based threat detection system with supporting
      microservices (in Python, using RabbitMQ for IPC) and a corresponding web
      front-end (with Angular).

    - Designed and implemented a lightweight JWT-based authentication system and
      corresponding middleware that provides role-based security and service
      discovery (in Python).

* **[Ultimate Software](http://ultimatesoftware.com)**

    Software Engineer, May 2013 &mdash; June 2014

    - As a DevOps engineer on the Build and Deployment team, I developed the
      internal tools and systems used for Ultimate's build automation and SaaS
      delivery.

    - I spearheaded the design and implementation of the front-end for an
      administration portal to be used by Ultimate's operations teams (utilizing
      CoffeeScript and Angular), and made significant modifications to the
      RESTful services on the back-end (C# using ASP.NET's Web API).

* **[Advanced Computing and Information Systems Laboratory](http://acis.ufl.edu/)**

    Undergraduate Research Assistant, Fall 2012 &mdash; Spring 2013

    - Accepted a Research Experience for Undergraduates position under
      [Prof. Renato Figueiredo](http://byron.acis.ufl.edu/) and
      Ph. D. candidate [Pierre
      St. Juste](http://pstjuste.blogspot.com/) working on distributed
      virtual private networks (i.e., IPOP [IP Over P2P], GroupVPN and
      SocialVPN). In particular, I assisted in the implementation of
      simple inter-cloud communication for the Contrail cloud platform
      via the utilization of a P2P overlay in the form of IPOP, and
      worked to secure the communication between nodes through the use
      of IPsec.  

    - The culmination of our efforts was
      [Acheron](https://github.com/acis-acheron/acheron).

* **[Ultimate Software](http://ultimatesoftware.com)**

    Software Engineer Intern (TechSTAR), Summer 2012

    - Worked on a myriad of projects as a member of the Architecture
      Refactoring Team, who were tasked with maintaining and improving
      both the underlying architecture and various other components of
      UltiPro, Ultimate Software's flagship enterprise Human Capital
      Management solution.

    - Utilized various languages and tools, including C#, ASP.NET,
      JavaScript, jQuery, Knockout, HTML 5 and CSS 3.

Open Source Experience
----------------------

Please see my [GitHub](https://githun.com/thomdixon) for a current listing of
open source projects and contributions. Some past contributions include patches to
[Bouncy Castle](http://www.bouncycastle.org), [D's tango](http://www.dsource.org/projects/tango/browser/trunk/tango/util/cipher),
[SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=+is%3Apr+author%3Athomdixon+), [Brunch](https://github.com/brunch/brunch/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Athomdixon+), and [LimeChat](https://github.com/psychs/limechat/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Athomdixon+).

Seminars &amp; Talks
--------------------

* **[Shamir Knows Alice and Bob's Shared Secret](http://goo.gl/Q5ss6)**, Spring 2013

    - Benjamin Franklin once wrote, "Three may keep a secret, if two
      of them be dead." Fortunately, advances in modern cryptography
      prevent us from having to croak the majority of our
      acquaintances. In this talk, we discussed methods of secret
      sharing (splitting), introduced in 1979 by Shamir and Blakely,
      which entail the distribution of a secret to a collection of
      constituents, of which only a sufficiently large subset may
      reconstruct the secret.

* **Programming for Aspiring Mathematicians**, Fall 2011 &mdash; Spring 2012

    - Gave a two-semester seminar on the fundamentals of computer
      programming to Pi Mu Epsilon, the University of Florida’s
      official mathematics club. Utilizing the Python programming
      language, my goal was to provide a glimpse into the world of
      general purpose programming, leading up to the piéce de
      résistance of introducing the elements of the [Sage mathematical
      system](http://sagemath.org).

Specialties
-----------

* **Concentration:**
    I'm very comfortable with full-stack development, but prefer to focus on
    backend development (particularly relating to security).

* **Languages:**
    I am most familiar with Python, C, and JavaScript, but have experience in
    a wide variety of languages and paradigms.

* **SCM:**
    Extensive experience with `git`.

* **Tools:**
    Long-time `emacs` user who has recently been making the switch to `vim`.
    Outside of the terminal, I use [Atom](http://atom.io).

* **Operating Systems:**
    Linux (extensive experience with Debian and its derivatives, some
    experience with the Fedora family (including RHEL), and Gentoo). Currently
    I run Mac OS X at home.

Memberships
-----------

I am a member of the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](http://eff.org), the
[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics](http://siam.org) and a
contributing member of [Software in the Public Interest](http://www.spi-inc.org).
