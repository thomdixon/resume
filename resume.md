Profile
-------

* I am a software developer with a passion for free and open source
  software, and a deep interest in computer security and cryptography
  (the majority of my open source contributions are to projects within
  this area). Some of my other pursuits outside of coding include
  playing electric guitar and practicing Brazilian jiu-jitsu.

Industry &amp; Research Experience
----------------------------------

* **[Ultimate Software](http://ultimatesoftware.com)**
    
    Border Security Engineer, June 2014 &mdash; Present

    - I'm currently a developer on the team responsible for creating Ultimate's
      Security Operations Center (SOC). I write and manage software that 
      assists in the detection and resolution of infiltration attempts.

* **[Ultimate Software](http://ultimatesoftware.com)**

    Software Engineer, May 2013 &mdash; June 2014

    - As a DevOps engineer on the Build and Deployment team, I developed the
      internal tools and systems used for Ultimate's build automation and SaaS
      delivery.

    - I spearheaded the design and implementation of an administration portal
      for our Operations teams, utilizing CoffeeScript, AngularJS, and
      Bootstrap 3 for the front end, and RESTful services implemented in C#
      using ASP.NET's Web API for the back end.

* **[Advanced Computing and Information Systems Laboratory](http://acis.ufl.edu/)**

    Undergraduate Research Assistant, Fall 2012 &mdash; Spring 2013

    - Accepted a Research Experience for Undergraduates position under
      [Prof. Renato Figueiredo](http://byron.acis.ufl.edu/) and
      Ph. D. candidate [Pierre
      St. Juste](http://pstjuste.blogspot.com/) working on distributed
      virtual private networks (i.e., IPOP [IP Over P2P], GroupVPN and
      SocialVPN). In particular, I assisted in the implementation of
      simple inter-cloud communication for the Contrail cloud platform
      via the utilization of a P2P overlay in the form of IPOP, and
      worked to secure the communication between nodes through the use
      of IPsec.  

    - The culmination of our efforts was
      [Acheron](https://github.com/acis-acheron/acheron).

* **[Ultimate Software](http://ultimatesoftware.com)**

    Software Engineer Intern (TechSTAR), Summer 2012

    - Worked on a myriad of projects as a member of the Architecture
      Refactoring Team, who are tasked with maintaining and improving
      both the underlying architecture and various other components of
      UltiPro, Ultimate Software's flagship enterprise Human Capital
      Management solution. 

    - Utilized various languages and tools, including C#, ASP.NET,
      JavaScript, jQuery, Knockout, HTML 5 and CSS 3.

Open Source Experience
----------------------

Please see my [GitHub](https://githun.com/thomdixon) for a more
complete listing of open source projects and contributions. I have
provided a list of selected projects below.

* **[SymPy Symbolic Computation Library](http://sympy.org)**

    Open Source Contributor, November 2010

    - Contributed a pull request to fix a number of the problems in
      Issue 2085, where several limits (particularly left- and
      right-sided limits) were not being calculated correctly. Also
      fixed a `ZeroDivisionError` when `cos(x)` was called with an
      infinite argument.

* **[dcrypt Cryptography Library](http://www.dsource.org/projects/dcrypt)**

    Project Founder, August 2008 &mdash; March 2010

    - Founded and maintained an open source initiative to provide a
      standard cryptographic toolkit (focusing on symmetric
      primitives) written entirely in the D programming language. As
      of March 2010, a majority of dcrypt was merged into the [Tango
      standard library](http://www.dsource.org/projects/tango).

* **[Bouncy Castle Java Cryptography Extension](http://www.bouncycastle.org)**

    Open Source Contributor, 2006 &mdash; 2008

    - Provided the initial implementations of the TEA, XTEA, Salsa20,
      ISSAC and direct-key NOEKEON ciphers, as well as further
      enhancements to XTEA (the pre-computation of round keys to speed up
      encryption and decryption).

Seminars &amp; Talks
--------------------

* **[Shamir Knows Alice and Bob's Shared Secret](http://goo.gl/Q5ss6)**, Spring 2013

    - Benjamin Franklin once wrote, "Three may keep a secret, if two
      of them be dead." Fortunately, advances in modern cryptography
      prevent us from having to croak the majority of our
      acquaintances. In this talk, we discussed methods of secret
      sharing (splitting), introduced in 1979 by Shamir and Blakely,
      which entail the distribution of a secret to a collection of
      constituents, of which only a sufficiently large subset may
      reconstruct the secret.

* **Programming for Aspiring Mathematicians**, Fall 2011 &mdash; Spring 2012

    - Gave a two-semester seminar on the fundamentals of computer
      programming to Pi Mu Epsilon, the University of Florida’s
      official mathematics club. Utilizing the Python programming
      language, my goal was to provide a glimpse into the world of
      general purpose programming, leading up to the piéce de
      résistance of introducing the elements of the [Sage mathematical
      system](http://sagemath.org).

Specialties
-----------

* **Concentration:**
    I'm very comfortable with full-stack development, but prefer to focus in 
    security and cryptography&mdash;from secure programming to penetration
    testing.

* **Languages:** 
    I am most familiar with Python, C, and JavaScript, but have experience in
    a wide variety of languages and paradigms.

* **SCM:**
    Extensive experience with Subversion (svn) and Git (with a
    preference towards Git).

* **Tools:**
    Very familiar with the GNU Compiler Collection and `emacs`
    text editor (though I've recently switched to Sublime Text). I love `tmux`.

* **Operating Systems:**
    Linux (extensive experience with Debian and its derivatives, some
    experience with the Fedora family (including RHEL), and Gentoo). Currently
    I run Mac OS X at home.

Memberships
-----------

I am a member of the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](http://eff.org), the
[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics](http://siam.org) and a
contributing member of [Software in the Public Interest](http://www.spi-inc.org).
